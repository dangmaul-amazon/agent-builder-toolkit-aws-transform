"""
Example tools for demonstrating various agent capabilities.

This module contains sample tools that showcase different patterns and features
for building custom agent tools. These tools are for demonstration and learning
purposes only and should not be used in production environments.

Available Tools:
- research_topic: Demonstrates background task execution with A2A progress updates.
                  REQUIRES AsyncBaseOrchestrator - will not work correctly with sync BaseOrchestrator.
