    """Abstract base processor for JobDeletionNotification.

    Provides the framework for handling job deletion notifications:
    1. Returns immediately so the Compute Service notify call does not time out
    2. Runs cleanup and AcknowledgeDeletion in a background task

    The Compute Service has a 20-second timeout on notify calls. Since partner
    cleanup may take longer (deleting S3 data, DDB entries, connector credentials,
    etc.), processing is done asynchronously. The Step Function relies on polling
    AcknowledgeDeletion status (not this HTTP response) to confirm completion.

    Partner teams MUST subclass this and implement cleanup().

        This method should NOT call AcknowledgeDeletion — the base class
