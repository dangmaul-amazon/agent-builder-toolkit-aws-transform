# System Architecture and Workflow 

## ATX Architecture

ATX provides two types of interfaces: WebApp-facing APIs for WebApp user access and partner agent-facing APIs for partner agents. The WebApp-facing APIs are accessed through the ATX frontend service, and user roles are used to control access and permissions at workspace level. In contrast, partner agents are authorized through tokens that the ATX platform generates and sends when an agent is invoked. This authorization token is generated at certain workspace and job context. Agent-facing APIs are also provided as a MCP server as one of ATX primitives we offered to partners.

Agents including ATX chat agent, partner domain orchestrator agent and subagents can communicate with each other through A2A message over ATX messaging API. ATX chat agent usually communicates with subagents through an orchestrator agent.

## Partner Agent Onboarding Architecture

Developer local development environment is Linux or Mac.

Bedrock AgentCore container accepted Docker runtime is linux/arm64

Partner knowledge base onboarding process is similar to this.

## Third Party Agent Invocation Flow

The overall flow for 3rd party agent invocation works as follow as in the below diagram,

Customer creates a job through ATX Chat, ATX starts processing the job;

ATX invokes Orchestrator Agent in Partner’s account. Orchestrator Agent starts job execution;

Orchestrator Agent makes ATX API requests (or via MCP) to invoke ATX vended Task Agent;

ATX invokes ATX vended Task Agent in AWS, which starts processing;

Orchestrator Agent invokes Partner Task Agent via ATX;

ATX indicates the job completion to Customer.

This flow demonstrates the high-level composability of agents in Partner AWS account and in ATX service, certain details such as running agents in Bedrock AgentCore will be revealed in subsequent sections, though the overall flow stays as the same.

Figure. 3rd Party Agent Invocation Flow (the example showing partner composing their Task Agent with an existing Task Agent vended by ATX, via an partner developed Orchestrator Agent)

## Customer Interaction - Chat flow

Previous section described the invocation flow of multiple agents, with same example, below the diagram describes the high-level Chat interaction flow among customer and agents via ATX:

Customer requests ATX Chat for their transformation needs in natural language;

ATX transfers the customer question to Orchestrator Agent in Partner account;

Orchestrator Agent requests information from ATX vended Task Agent through ATX;

ATX vended Task Agent responds, then ATX transfers the details to Orchestrator Agent;

Orchestrator Agent requests additional information from Task Agent running in Partner account;

Partner Task Agent responds, then ATX transfers the details to Orchestrator Agent;

Orchestrator Agent combines outputs from both Task Agents and returns to ATX;

ATX returns the requested the result through ATX Chat to Customer.

In this diagram, agents communicate with each other using Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A) powered by ATX service; agents may communicate using additional mechanisms such as ATX provided Artifact Store API etc., which will be revealed in further details in this guide. 

Figure. 3rd Party Agent Customer Interaction Flow (the example showing customer interacting with two Task Agent, one ATX Task Agent and one Partner Task Agent; customer request is routed to Orchestrator Agent and communicated enabled by ATX service provided A2A )

## Agent Lifecycle Management

To be deployed into production, an agent goes through a series of stages. First, a partner agent builder performs local development, building, and testing. Once ready, the agent is uploaded to Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and deployed with Bedrock AgentCore. The agent is then registered with the ATX agentic registry, making it ready to be used for jobs created by the ATX platform.

The partner agent builder sets up the local agent development environment. 

The agent builder downloads the ATX base agent to use as a starting point. 

The agent builder customizes and writes the agent code. 

The agent is built locally into a container. 

The agent is run locally for development testing by providing it with an API key to access the dev testing ATX platform endpoint. 

Once local development testing is complete, the agent builder can rebuild the agent with the platform as ARM64 for Bedrock AgentCore. 

The agent builder tags the container image and uploads it to the partner account ECR container repository. 

The agent builder registers their ECR agent container with the agent core using the AWS console, CLI, SDK, or API.

The agent builder then registers the Bedrock AgentCore runtime to the ATX agent registry by providing an agent card, role, and ARN. 

The ATX platform will trigger the agent when a job is created in the ATX WebApp that can be served by this agent.

The agent will run in the partner Bedrock AgentCore runtime. 

Partners can monitor and debug the agent through CloudWatch logs.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

At least one AWS account with credential setup to access the account through AWS CLI or console

Work with ATX foundation team to

allow-list the account for ATX service

get an API key, testing workspace and job ID for agent development testing

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Python 3.10 and above

IDE – Intellij/PyCharm/VS Code

Docker

# Debian distribution
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

# RPM distribution
sudo yum install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

AWS CLI

# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html
snap install aws-cli --classic

awscurl

pip install awscurl

AWS Transform base agent package (including Bedrock AgentCore SDK, StrandsAgent SDK and ATX service primitives as MCP server). As of now, ATX Foundation team will provide packages through S3 under NDA.

# Download from AWS console of an allowlisted account
https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/object/atx-foundation-partner-artifacts-us-east-1?region=us-east-1&bucketType=general&prefix=packages/ElasticGumbyPlatformWorkshopAgent.zip


# or use AWS CLI to download
aws s3 cp s3://atx-foundation-partner-artifacts-us-east-1/packages/ElasticGumbyPlatformWorkshopAgent.zip ./

# Building Your Agent

## Low Code

You can use sample code package: ElasticGumbyPlatformWorkshopAgent to build your agent. As of now, AWS team will provide packages through S3. Below are the steps:  

Create a Python project in your development environment

Take base agent package as a dependent package

Define a domain agent class, which extends the base agent

Create a LLM system prompt for the domain agent

Create StrandsAgent compatible tool functions

Specify the local and remote MCP servers

Optionally, you can specify a list of subagents that can be used by one orchestrator agent

Extend the agent implementation by customizing the API endpoints the agent supports:

POST /invocations

GET /ping

POST /message/send

Get the input parameters through /invocations message.

### Using ATX Base Agent with AgentCore (Recommended)

For partners deploying to AWS Bedrock AgentCore, the base agent package provides AgentRuntimeServer that handles all AgentCore integration automatically:

Key Benefits: 

JSON-RPC 2.0 Protocol: Automatic handling of AgentCore’s single /invocations endpoint

Context Initialization: Automatic extraction of ATX context from any request type

Session Management: Built-in support for AgentCore’s session isolation

A2A Compatibility: Native support for Agent-to-Agent messaging

    server.start()

if __name__ == "__main__":

    main()

### Custom Agent Implementation

Above code uses out-of-box default factories to construct agents, you may modify them to customize your agent, or even create your own agent factory implementation for even more control.

#### Default Orchestrator Agent Example

As an example, the default factory creates a fully-featured orchestrator with:

Episodic memory for storing agent experiences

Conversation tracking across multiple sources

Lifecycle hooks for conversation and memory events

You may customize it plugging additional MCP clients for your MCP servers, or bringing additional domain specify tools as custom tools.

def create_default_orchestrator(

    mcp_client: Optional[MCPClient] = None,

    storage_dir: str = "/tmp/orchestrator_agent",

    system_prompt: Optional[str] = None,

) -> BaseOrchestrator:

…

    # Create orchestrator with explicit hooks

    orchestrator = BaseOrchestrator(

        system_prompt=system_prompt,

        hooks=hooks,

        mcp_clients=[mcp_client] if mcp_client is not None else None,

        region_name=os.getenv("AWS_REGION") or "us-east-1",

        custom_tools=memory_tools,

    )

    return orchestrator

#### Default Task Agent Example

As an example for task agent (sub agent), this factory creates a lightweight subagent without memory or conversation tracking.

Similarly, you may plug-in your domain or business logic centric MCP server or LLM tools to customize a task agent to be an domain task executor.

def create_default_subagent(

    system_prompt: str,

    mcp_client: Optional[MCPClient] = None,

) -> BaseSubagent:

…

    # Create subagent with minimal configuration

    subagent = BaseSubagent(

        system_prompt=system_prompt,

        mcp_clients=[mcp_client] if mcp_client is not None else None,

        region_name=os.getenv("AWS_REGION") or "us-east-1",

    )

    return subagent

#### Default Orchestrator Agent with Task Agent Example

One may also choose to leverage multi-agents architecture to run agentic workflow with ATX, below is an example of an orchestrator agent capable of communicating via task agent using A2A.

Note that, the task agent is made visible to the orchestrator agent via the subagent registry tool, and can be tasked with work via send message tool so that it may receive natural language communication from orchestrator agent via A2A.

def create_default_orchestrator_with_subagent(

    system_prompt: str,

    mcp_client: Optional[MCPClient] = None,

    storage_dir: str = "/tmp/orchestrator_agent",

) -> BaseOrchestrator:

    # Create subagent discovery tool

    subagent_registry_tools = SubagentRegistryTools()

    custom_tools.append(subagent_registry_tools.discover_subagents)

    # Create send message to subagent tool

    send_message_tools = SendMessageTools()

    custom_tools.append(send_message_tools.send_message_to_subagent)

…

    # Create orchestrator with explicit hooks

    orchestrator = BaseOrchestrator(

        system_prompt=system_prompt,

        hooks=hooks,

        mcp_clients=[mcp_client] if mcp_client is not None else None,

        region_name=os.getenv("AWS_REGION") or "us-east-1",

        custom_tools=custom_tools,

    )

Docker build to get a local Docker image. If the local machine is Mac, use platform linux/arm64, if intel or amd based, please use —platform linux/amd64.

docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t genesis-agent:latest -f Dockerfile .

(Optionally) Package and deploy to Bedrock AgentCore leveraging out-of-box bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit (https://github.com/aws/bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit)

pip install bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit

# Configure and deploy (auto-creates all required resources
# including Dockerfile and building Docker image)
agentcore configure -e my_atx_agent.py 
agentcore launch 

# Test your deployed agent agentcore invoke '{"prompt": "tell me a joke"}'

# Developer Testing

Before onboarding your agents with ATX, it is better to perform some local developer testing to identify the potential bugs and problems. Generally, there’s three stages of testing you may perform:

Developer Local Testing

AgentCore Deployed Agent Testing

Testing with ATX Web

This section covers 1 and 2, where 3 requires registering your AgentCore ready agents with ATX first.

## Developer Local Testing

### Local Testing IAM Permissions

Before you start testing, here is the minimal permission you need to run the agent locally and the default bedrock model. You can use other models as long as you enable them from Bedrock console. 

Minimal IAM user/role policy:
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "bedrockModelPolicy",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "atxPolicy",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "eg-agenticapi:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}


Default Bedrock Model: us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0

IMPORTANT: Always use cross-region inference profile IDs (prefixed with "us.") instead of raw model IDs when calling Bedrock. Raw model IDs like "anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0" will fail with "Invocation with on-demand throughput isn't supported". Use "us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0" instead.

NOTE: When adding permissions for eg-agenticapi using the IAM console would show an Error indicating Invalid Service in Action (sample image below). This is because the service is not a public AWS Service. This is not a blocker, and clicking the Next should create the IAM policy.

IAM Console Error

### Local Testing Environment Variables

Here are the environment variables before running the agent locally, ask your associated SA to get the auth token via AWS Secrets Manager.

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-role-user-access-key>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-role-user-secret-access-key>
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<your-role-user-session-token-key> (ignore this if you use IAM user to test)
export WORKSPACE_ID=<from-secrets-manager>
export JOB_ID=<from-secrets-manager>
export AGENT_INSTANCE_ID=<from-secrets-manager>
export AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN=<from-secrets-manager>
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export STAGE=gamma

Domain agent can be invoked locally as a Docker container

Workspace Id and job Id can be passed into the agent through environment variable or invocations message or send message A2A message.

Agents can use the API key to access the agentic API through the MCP server (ATX primitives)

Agents can get the job

Agents can generate a job plan and publish it to the job plan tree

Agents can execute the plan by calling specific subagents or tools

Agents can complete the job

Agents can be stopped and resumed

Agents should respond to the health check

Agents produced trajectories shall be in the formation of open telemetry.

Agents can be checkpointed

## AgentCore Deployed Agent Testing

After completing developer local testing, one should consider package the agent code, deploy to Bedrock AgentCore and test invoking the deployed agent in AgentCore once more.

This testing process simulates how ATX service invokes the deployed agent in production, making sure any potential integration issues are uncovered.

### Build and Publish Agent Docker Image

DOCKER_REPO=orch-agent

ECR_REPO=my-orch-agent

AWS_REGION=us-east-1

AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXX

Wrap up all the local changes and rebuild the local docker container image with platform ARM since agent core only support ARM platform so far.

docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t ${DOCKER_REPO} -f Dockerfile .

(Optional) If you haven’t created an ECR repository to bush the image, run the following to create an ECR repository,

aws ecr create-repository --repository-name ${ECR_REPO} --region ${AWS_REGION}

Tag the container and upload it to ECR in your AWS account

aws ecr get-login-password --region ${AWS_REGION} | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com

docker tag $(docker images ${DOCKER_REPO} --quiet | head -n 1) ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/${ECR_REPO}:latest

Publish the image to ECR

docker push ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/${ECR_REPO}:latest

### Create AgentCore Execution Role

Bedrock AgentCore Runtime requires one execution role to assume so that the agent instance could access ATX service and other AWS resources, use the following template to create an IAM role,

AgentCoreExecutionRole:

AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'

NOTE: When adding permissions for eg-agenticapi using the IAM console, it would show an Error indicating Invalid Service in Action (sample image below). This is because the service is not a public AWS Service. 

This is not a blocker, and clicking the Next should create the IAM policy.

Figure. IAM Console Error (you may see an Invalid Servie in Action error when adding roles with eg-agenticapi related actions, this error can be safely ignored; ATX will provide public facing APIs for partner development testing to remove this error mesage)

### Create AgentCore Runtime

Run the following command to recreate an AgentCore Runtime:

For the RoleArn parameter, please provide the IAM role ARN created in step 5.2.2

AGENT_CORE_RUNTIME_NAME=myorchagent

AGENT_CORE_RUNTIME_DESCRIPTION="Orchestrator agent"

AGENT_CORE_RUNTIME_ROLE_NAME=AgentCoreExecutionRole

ATX_STAGE=gamma

aws bedrock-agentcore-control create-agent-runtime \

--agent-runtime-name "$AGENT_CORE_RUNTIME_NAME" \

--description "${AGENT_CORE_RUNTIME_DESCRIPTION}" \

--agent-runtime-artifact '{"containerConfiguration":{"containerUri":"'${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}'.dkr.ecr.'${AWS_REGION}'.amazonaws.com/'${ECR_REPO}':latest"}}' \

--role-arn "arn:aws:iam::${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:role/${AGENT_CORE_RUNTIME_ROLE_NAME}" \

--network-configuration '{"networkMode":"PUBLIC"}' \

--protocol-configuration '{"serverProtocol":"HTTP"}' \

--environment-variables '{"STAGE":"'${ATX_STAGE}'"}' \

--region ${AWS_REGION}

You should see an output like the following,

{
 "agentRuntimeArn": "arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-east-1:<account_id>:runtime/myorchagent-cPfBc86tYG",
 "workloadIdentityDetails": {
  "workloadIdentityArn": "arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-east-1:<account_id>:workload-id entity-directory/default/workload-identity/myorchagent-cPfBc86tYG"
  },
 "agentRuntimeId": "myorchagent-cPfBc86tYG",
 "agentRuntimeVersion": "1",
 "createdAt": "2025-09-14T22:59:16.219208+00:00",
 "status": "CREATING"
}

### Invoke AgentCore Runtime

#### AgentCore Sandbox

TBD

#### AWS CLI

After the AgentCore Runtime is successfully deployed, you may simulate the process ATX invoking your agent via running the following commands.

In order enable your agent communicating with ATX service, same tokens used in 5.1.2 are needed to construct a payload. Note that the payload used to invoke AgentCore Runtime needs to be encoded with Base64:

echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"atx_agent/invoke","params":{"invocationContext":{"jobMetadata":{"workspaceId":"'$WORKSPACE_ID'","jobId":"'$JOB_ID'"},"authorizationToken":"'$AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN'"},"agentInstanceId":"'$AGENT_INSTANCE_ID'"}}' | base64

aws bedrock-agentcore invoke-agent-runtime \
--agent-runtime-arn "arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-east-1:<account_id>:runtime/myorchagent-cPfBc86tYG" \
--content-type "application/json" \
--accept "application/json" \
--payload '<base64 payload>' \
--region us-east-1 \
response.json

A successfully invocation of the agent shows something similar to the following. 

{
"runtimeSessionId": "72d9e817-cc48-4303-8a7c-6000e94e83ed",
"traceId": "Root=1-68c753f3-59493a73272dda6f3f3a48c0;Self=1-68c753f3-244ee838045c18525874fc8a",
"baggage": "Self=1-68c753f3-244ee838045c18525874fc8a,session.id=72d9e817-cc48-4303-8a7c-6000e94e83ed",
"contentType": "application/json",
"statusCode": 200
}

The CloudWatch Logs for the invocation would be available in a Log Group created for the AgentRuntime, eg.

/aws/bedrock-agentcore/runtimes/myorchagent-cPfBc86tYG -DEFAULT

### Testing AgentCore Runtime with Additional Operations

#### AgentCore Protocol Understanding

JSON-RPC 2.0 Communication: AgentCore uses JSON-RPC 2.0 for all agent communication. Your agent receives these methods via /invocations:

atx_agent/invoke - Agent invocation

atx_agent/healthcheck - Health status check

atx_agent/notify - Platform notifications

atx_agent/restore - State restoration

atx_agent/stop - Graceful shutdown

message/send - A2A messaging (follows A2A protocol)

tasks/get - Task retrieval

Session Isolation: AgentCore uses runtimeSessionId for isolation. ATX automatically generates session IDs using:

workspaceId_jobId_agentInstanceId

#### Test message/send

message/send operation is an important operation used for,

Orchestrator Agent <-> ATX Chat

Orchestrator Agent <-> Task Agent

Task Agent <-> Task Agent

Communications.

You may test if your agent can receive a message/send call via the following commands. Firstly construct the payload using Base64,

export MESSAGE=<Some natural language utterances to test your agent>

echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"message/send","params":{"message":{"role":"user","parts":[{"kind":"text","text":"'$MESSAGE'"}],"messageId":"'$(uuidgen)'","kind":"message","metadata":{"ATX_A2A.AgentInitializationContext":{"jobMetadata":{"workspaceId":"'$WORKSPACE_ID'","jobId":"'$JOB_ID'"},"agentInstanceId":"'$AGENT_INSTANCE_ID'","authorizationToken":"'$AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN'"}},"extensions":["ATX_A2A.AgentInitializationContext"]}}}' | base64

Now you may invoke your agent with,

aws bedrock-agentcore invoke-agent-runtime \
--agent-runtime-arn "arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-east-1:<account_id>:runtime/myorchagent-cPfBc86tYG" \
--runtime-session-id "72d9e817-cc48-4303-8a7c-6000e94e83ed" \
--content-type "application/json" \
--accept "application/json" \
--payload 'eyJqc29ucnBjIjoiMi4wIiwibWV0aG9kIjoibWVzc2FnZS9zZW5kIiwicGFyYW1zIjp7Im1lc3NhZ2UiOnsicm9sZSI6InVzZXIiLCJwYXJ0cyI6W3sia2luZCI6InRleHQiLCJ0ZXh0IjoiV2hhdCBpcyBteSBqb2Igc3RhdHVzIn1dLCJtZXNzYWdlSWQiOiJENEI1Q0FDNC1COUI4LTRFOTUtODJGNy01RDdENTc0OEIxM0IiLCJraW5kIjoibWVzc2FnZSIsIm1ldGFkYXRhIjp7IkFUWF9BMkEuQWdlbnRJbml0aWFsaXphdGlvbkNvbnRleHQiOnsiam9iTWV0YWRhdGEiOnsid29ya3NwYWNlSWQiOiI0NTczZDllOC1jMTRmLTRiODQtYjE2Mi0yZGM3MWM0MWVmMDQiLCJqb2JJZCI6IjAwMDAwMDAwLTAwMDAtMDAwMC0wMDAwLTAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMCJ9LCJhZ2VudEluc3RhbmNlSWQiOiIxMTExMTExMS0xMTExLTExMTEtMTExMS0xMTExMTExMTExMTEiLCJhdXRob3JpemF0aW9uVG9rZW4iOiJURU1QT1JBUllfQVVUSF

--region us-east-1 \
response.json

A successfully invocation of the agent shows something like the following

{
"runtimeSessionId": "72d9e817-cc48-4303-8a7c-6000e94e83ed",
"traceId": "Root=1-68c756f6-4a82e1b67369ed127625f74b;Self=1-68c756f6-70f4f8170c0cebe340d76dbb",
"baggage": "Self=1-68c756f6-70f4f8170c0cebe340d76dbb,session.id=72d9e817-cc48-4303-8a7c-6000e94e83ed",
"contentType": "application/json",
"statusCode": 200
}

You may see the response.json somewhat like,

{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"role":"agent","parts":[{"text":"I'm working on your request and will get back to you shortly.","kind":"text"}],"messageId":"D4B5CAC4-B9B8-4E95-82F7-5D7D5748B13B","kind":"message","metadata":null,"extensions":null,"referenceTaskIds":null,"taskId":null,"contextId":null},"error":null,"id":null}

# Onboarding and Gamma Webapp Testing (deprecated)

When you finish your developer testing and everything is working as expected, you should consider onboarding the agent to ATX platform in gamma (pre-prod) environment.

You will go through three stages, 1/Upload your local agent container into ECR, 2/Deploy your ECR agent container with Bedrock AgentCore, and 3/Bring the Bedrock AgentCore runtime ARN with ATX to be invoked.

Prepare a role for partner to assume and access the ECR repository, deployment in agent core. This is mandatory when you use automated onboarding script to onboard agents.

## Register Agent Core Agent with ATX

In this step, you’ll leverage ATX Agent Registry API to register your agent onto ATX service. 

For the moment, your agents could be registered to ATX gamma or production environments. We highly recommend that you register agents in production environment where you can publish and test agents without the assistance of SA and use ATX WebApp directly. If you decide to stay with gamma environment, please make sure to communicate with your SA to coordinate testing from ATX webapp, once you’re able to register your agents to ATX.

For Production WebApp Testing, please refer to Section 6.4.  For Gamma WebApp Testing, please refer to Section 6.3.

### Prerequisites and Setup

Prerequisites

Account Allowlisting: Contact your SA to allowlist your AWS account with the Dynamic Registry

CLI Model Setup: Download and configure the latest registry model

#### Configure necessary IAM Permissions

Please ensure you use an IAM Principal (user/role) with the following IAM Permissions so that you can communicate with ATX Agent Registry Service.

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "ATXAgentRegistryAccessStatement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "transform-registry:RegisterAgent",
        "transform-registry:PublishAgentVersion",
        "transform-registry:UpdatePublisherAccessControl",

        "transform-registry:ListAgentByPublisher",
        "transform-registry:ListAgentAccessControl",
        "transform-registry:GetAgent",
        "transform-registry:GetAgentVersion"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

#### Configure ATX Agent Registry CLI

The following command assumes you have received  SDK code via your SA, i.e., atxagentregistryexternal-2022-07-26.normal.json is provided to your under the directory of src/dependencies/atxagentregistryexternal

aws configure add-model --service-name agent-registry --service-model file://atxagentregistryexternal-2022-07-26.normal.json

In Gamma environment, you may verify with 

aws agent-registry help --endpoint https://iad.gamma.agent-registry-external.elastic-gumby.ai.aws.dev | tee

For additional documentation specification of ATX Agent Registry, please see ATX Agent Registry External API Specification.

### Register Agent with ATX

In this step you will register your agent with ATX, you may publish new versions, update access control with sub-sequent APIs. We provide the production endpoint and gamma endpoint for you to choose. Simply replace the <ENDPOINT_URL> with the stage you want to register agents.

Gamma endpoint: https://iad.gamma.agent-registry-external.elastic-gumby.ai.aws.dev

Production endpoint: https://iad.prod.agent-registry-external.elastic-gumby.ai.aws.dev

New required fields:

`ownerType`

`DIRECT_AGENT`: you allow list your agents to be visible to selected customers AWS account IDs

`MARKETPLACE_AGENT`: agents distributed via AWS Agent Market Place

`customerConfigurationRequired`: set to `True` if agent is deployed to your customer account, keep it `False` during development/testing phase

`customerConfiguredAgentDependencies`: Optional, required only for orchestrator agents that depend on customer-configured subagents

{

    "name": "zongrenl-atx-devguide-1025-test",

    "metadata": {

        "type": "SUB_AGENT",

        "description": "Custom agent for enterprise workload transformation",

        "ownerName": "zongrenl@amazon.com",

        "ownerContactInfo": "AWS/QTransform/ExternalPartners",

        "ownerType": "DIRECT_AGENT",

        "customerConfigurationRequired": false

    }

}

Register the agent to either gamma or production environment. 

aws agent-registry register-agent \

    --cli-input-json file://register-agent.json \

    --endpoint-url <ENDPOINT_URL> \

--region us-east-1

Expected response:

{

    "name": "zongrenl-atx-devguide-1025-test",

"visibility": "RESTRICTED"

}

### Publish An Agent Version

Before publishing an agent version, make sure to create a role for ATX platform to assume to invoke your Agent Core runtime.

AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Description: >
  IAM Role for automated AWS Bedrock Agent access for the ATX platform.

Resources:
  BedrockAgentRole:
    Type: "AWS::IAM::Role"
    Properties:
      RoleName: "ATXAgentInvokeRole"
      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
        Version: "2012-10-17"
        Statement:
          - Effect: "Allow"
            Principal:
              Service: 
                - "gamma.us-east-1.compute.elastic-gumby.aws.internal"
            Action: "sts:AssumeRole"
      Policies:
        - PolicyName: "Bedrock-AgentRuntime-Policy"
          PolicyDocument:
            Version: "2012-10-17"
            Statement:
              - Effect: "Allow"
                Action:
                  - "bedrock-agentcore:InvokeAgentRuntime"
                  - "bedrock-agentcore:StopRuntimeSession"
                Resource: "*"

Now create your agent version configuration:

{

    "name": "zongrenl-atx-devguide-1025-test",

    "version": "1.0.0",

    "configuration": {

        "shortDescription": "Custom enterprise transformation agent",

        "agentCard": {},

        "computeConfiguration": {

            "provisionedComputeConfiguration": {

                "agentCoreConfiguration": {

                    "atxAccessRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::<YOUR ACCOUNT>:role/ATXAgentInvokeRole ",

                    "runtimeArn": "arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-east-1:<YOUR ACCOUNT>:runtime/showcase_agent_gamma-njGcyn6Ixv",

                    "qualifier": "DEFAULT"

                }

            }

        },

        "agentResiliencyConfiguration": {

            "partnerControllerRetryWindowMinutes": 6,

            "agentRecoveryConfiguration": {

                "recoveryWaitTimeSeconds": 60

            }

        },

        "inputPayloadSchema": {

            "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",

            "type": "object",

            "properties": {}

        },

        "outputPayloadSchema": {

            "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",

            "type": "object",

            "properties": {}

        },

        "monitoringType": "HEALTHCHECK",

        "notificationsEnabled": "ENABLED",

        "objectiveNegotiationPrompt": "Your agent's objective negotiation prompt here"

    }

}

Publish the version:

aws external-registry publish-agent-version \

    --cli-input-json file://publish-version.json \

    --endpoint-url <ENDPOINT_URL> \

    --region us-east-1

Expected response:

{

    "name": "zongrenl-atx-devguide-1025-test",

    "version": "1.0.1",

    "status": "ACTIVE"

}

### Configure Access Control

By default, agents are created with RESTRICTED visibility. update-publisher-access-control API allows to add authorized AWS accounts to use the agents.

To enable webapp testing in gamma, please make sure to allow access for 348823729159 account from ATX (used for later webapp testing). To enable webapp in production, please make sure to allow access for your own AWS account

{

    "agentName": "zongrenl-atx-devguide-1025-test",

    "customerAccountId": "<customerAccountId>", # 348823729159 in gamma, or your own AWS account in prod

    "accessControl": "ENABLED"

}

Update publisher access control:

aws external-registry update-publisher-access-control \

    --cli-input-json file://access-control.json \

    --endpoint-url <ENDPOINT_URL> \

    --region us-east-1

Verify access control:

aws external-registry list-agent-access-control \

    --name zongrenl-atx-devguide-1025-test \

    --endpoint <ENDPOINT_URL> \

    --region us-east-1

Expected responses:

{

    "customerAccountIdList": [

        "<customerAccountId>"

    ],

    "visibility": "RESTRICTED"

}

### Agent Management and Monitoring

#### List Your Published Agents

View all agents you have published to the Dynamic Registry:

aws external-registry list-agents-by-publisher \

    --endpoint-url <ENDPOINT_URL>\

    --region us-east-1

Expected responses:

{

    "items": [

        "zongrenl-atx-devguide-1025-test"

    ]

}

#### Get Agent Details

Retrieve metadata for a specific agent:

{

    "name": "zongrenl-atx-devguide-1025-test",

    "version": "1.0.1"

}

aws external-registry get-agent-version \

    --cli-input-json file://get-agent-details.json \

    --endpoint-url <ENDPOINT_URL>\

--region us-east-1

## Coordinate ATX Webapp UAT Testing via SA 

You can skip this step if you register agents in production environments. 

Once completing all above steps, please coordinate with your assigned SA, so that you can testing your agents in ATX gamma webapp.

## Automate Test new job without WebApp (only applicable to agents registered in gamma environment)

You can skip this step if you register agents in production environments.

# Onboarding and Production Webapp Testing

When you finish your developer testing and everything is working as expected, you can onboard your agent to ATX production environment and use WebApp for agent testing. 

You will go through three stages, 

Upload your local agent container into ECR 

Deploy your ECR agent container with Bedrock AgentCore, 

Bring the Bedrock AgentCore runtime ARN with ATX to be invoked.

## Update local agent container into ECR 

Please reference the Section 5.7 for how to Build and Publish Agent Image to publish image to your AWS account. After you push the image, you should be able to see an image with latest image tag with the recent pushed time.

## Deploy your ECR container with Bedrock AgentCore 

### Create AgentCoreExecutionRole

Create AgentCoreExecutionRole in the IAM console with trusted Relationship using this template.

{

    "Version": "2012-10-17",

    "Statement": [

        {

            "Sid": "AllowAccessToBedrockAgentcore",

            "Effect": "Allow",

            "Principal": {

            },

            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"

        }

    ]

}

Then add below inline policy named as `ATXAgent-AgentCoreExecutionRolePolicy`. Replace the accountId to your own AWS account.

You could see 2 Errors shown up in IAM policy but it’s fine to proceed with next button.

### Create Bedrock AgentCore Runtime

Create Bedrock AgentCore Runtime in Account-A by specifying the image URI and AgentCoreExecutionRole and following environment variables 

STAGE: prod

REGION: us-east-1

Click the hosting Agent and you could be able to provision the Agent Runtime and you can find the `agentRuntimeArn` in “View invocation code”.

## Register Agent with ATX

In this step you will register your agent with ATX, you may publish new versions, update access control with sub-sequent APIs. We provide the production endpoint

Production endpoint: https://iad.prod.agent-registry-external.elastic-gumby.ai.aws.dev

Depending on your testing scenarios, you need to register agent with different configuration regarding two fields: 

`customerConfigurationRequired`: Required. 

keep it `false` during your development/testing phase to verify agent functionality.

Set to `true` when agent is ready for customer to use. Agent would be deployed to your customer’s AgentCore Runtime.

` customerConfiguredAgentDependencies`: Optional, required only for orchestrator agents that depend on customer-configured subagents when `customerConfigurationRequired` is set as `true`

Other New required fields:

`ownerType`

`DIRECT_AGENT`: you allow list your agents to be visible to selected customers AWS account IDs

`MARKETPLACE_AGENT`: agents distributed via AWS Agent Market Place

Other New optional fields

`jobOrchestrator`: default value is false, set it as true if this agent is Orchestrator Agent.

`jobOrchestratorMetadata`: optional 

chatUILabel: required, displaying agent name in the selection buttons of ATX chat

chatAgentIdentifier: required, String used by agent for quick detection of capabilities in ATX chat.

a2aSupported: required, if agent supports A2A 

Example json - `register-agent.json` 

{

  "name": "dynamic-showcase-agent-agentcore",

  "metadata": {

    "type": "ORCHESTRATOR_AGENT",

    "description": "Deep",

    "ownerName": "linchenk",

    "ownerContactInfo": "linchenk+test@amazon.com",

    "ownerType": "DIRECT_AGENT",

    "customerConfigurationRequired": false,

    "jobOrchestrator": true,

    "jobOrchestratorMetadata": {

      "chatUILabel": "Deep research Agent to perform general transformation",

      "chatAgentIdentifier": "dynamic-showcase-agent-agentcore",

      "a2aSupported": true

    }

  }

}

Register the agent with your own AWS credential

aws agent-registry register-agent \

    --cli-input-json file://register-agent.json \

    --endpoint-url https://iad.prod.agent-registry-external.elastic-gumby.ai.aws.dev \

--region us-east-1

Expected response:

{

    "name": "dynamic-showcase-agent-agentcore",

"visibility": "RESTRICTED"

}

### Publish An Agent Version

Before publishing an agent version, make sure to create a role(named: ATXAgentInvokeRole) for ATX platform to assume to invoke your Agent Core runtime.

Trust policy for this role 

{

	"Version": "2012-10-17",

	"Statement": [

		{

			"Effect": "Allow",

			"Principal": {

				"Service": "prod.us-east-1.compute.elastic-gumby.aws.internal"

			},

			"Action": "sts:AssumeRole"

		}

	]

}

Create an inline policy with below template and named as `ATX-BedrockAgentRuntimePolicy` and then attach to this role 

{

    "Version": "2012-10-17",

    "Statement": [

        {

            "Action": [

                "bedrock-agentcore:GetAgentRuntime",

                "bedrock-agentcore:GetAgentRuntimeEndpoint",

                "bedrock-agentcore:InvokeAgentRuntime",

                "bedrock-agentcore:ListAgentRuntimeEndpoints",

                "bedrock-agentcore:ListAgentRuntimeVersions",

                "bedrock-agentcore:ListAgentRuntimes",

                "bedrock-agentcore:StopRuntimeSession"

            ],

            "Resource": "*",

            "Effect": "Allow",

            "Sid": "ATXAgentCoreRuntimePermissions"

        }

    ]

}

Now create your agent version configuration. Example JSON `publish-agent-version.json`. Change the accountId in the `atxAccessRoleArn` and replace your own AgentCore Runtime Arn.

{

  "name": "dynamic-showcase-agent-agentcore",

  "version": "1.0.0",

  "configuration": {

    "shortDescription": "Deep research Agent to perform general transformation",

          "qualifier": "DEFAULT"

        }

      }

    },

    "agentResiliencyConfiguration": {

      "partnerControllerRetryWindowMinutes": 6,

    "agentCard": {}

  }

}

Publish the version:

aws agent-registry publish-agent-version \

    --cli-input-json file://publish-agent-version.json \

    --endpoint-url https://iad.prod.agent-registry-external.elastic-gumby.ai.aws.dev \

    --region us-east-1

Expected response:

{

    "name": "dynamic-showcase-agent-agentcore",

    "version": "1.0.1",

    "status": "ACTIVE"

}

### Configure Access Control

By default, agents are created with RESTRICTED visibility. update-publisher-access-control API allows to add authorized AWS accounts to use the agents. 

Example JSON - `access-control.json`. You can use the Agent publisher accountId as the customerAccountId for development testing.

{

    "agentName": "dynamic-showcase-agent-agentcore",

    "customerAccountId": "<customerAccountId>",

    "accessControl": "ENABLED"

}

Update publisher access control:

aws agent-registry update-publisher-access-control \

    --cli-input-json file://access-control.json \

    --endpoint-url https://iad.prod.agent-registry-external.elastic-gumby.ai.aws.dev \

    --region us-east-1

Verify access control:

aws agent-registry list-agent-access-control \

    --name dynamic-showcase-agent-agentcore \

    --endpoint-url https://iad.prod.agent-registry-external.elastic-gumby.ai.aws.dev \

    --region us-east-1

Expected responses:

{

    "customerAccountIdList": [

        "<customerAccountId>"

    ],

    "visibility": "RESTRICTED"

}

### Agent Management and Monitoring

#### List Your Published Agents

## ATX Prod WebApp testing 

You can create the ATX profile in your own AWS account which is the `customerAccountId` allowlisted for agent usage and start testing without the assistance of SA. In this case, you can publish new version of agents and test it unlimited by yourself.

Step1: Login your AWS console and go to `AWS Transform` service (https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1#). Hit `Get started` and create the ATX profile 

In the setting, you could be able to see your ATX application. 

Step2: Add new users to AWS Transform, example like this. Or you can go to `IAM Identity Center` to create a group and add users there. 

Figure  - Add new users from ATX console

Figure  - Create a group and add users in IAM Identity Center

For each user that is allowed to access ATX application, Admin needs to send email verification link and asks user to set up password. 

Step3: Login the ATX WebApp. Use the `Web application URL` in step 1 in ATX console and paste it in the browser. It will lead you to the log in page and you can fill in username and password.

Step4: Create a new workspace and ask for questions like “What kind of job types are available to use?”. Your registered agent should show up. For example, our registered agent is “dynamic-showcase-agent-agentcore”. Then you can use natural language “create a job for 5. Dynamic-showcase-agent-agentcore”

Step5. For debugging, you would be able to get jobId directly from webapp url part - ` workspace/99a33b83-f739-4e83-8ff6-9eae537962cd/job/669f2d52-4f3e-4eb5-8bbd-b663c4fbad2d`. You can go to CloudWatch Logs Insights in your AWS account where you deploy the AgentCore Runtime, to query by jobId and check agent log. 

Example CloudWatch log query

fields @timestamp, @message, @logStream, @log

| filter @message like /<jobId>/

| sort @timestamp desc

| limit 10000

## External Agentic API support [To Be released]

ATX platform will release external Agentic API support in Agent SDK which requires no allowlisting on ATX side and could speed up the development. In order to use this feature, simply update the AgentCore Runtime hosting to add the new environment variable `USE_EXTERNAL_AGENTIC_API=true`

Example screenshot: 

For current testing, you can set `USE_EXTERNAL_AGENTIC_API=false` if your testing account is allowlisted to use Internal Agentic API

## Publish Agent to be consumed in customer account [WIP]

If you have finished the development testing, you can now make agent available to run in customer account. Instructions would be added later.

# FAQ

## ATX Concepts FAQs

### What is job plan of an ATX job?

ATX job plan outlines the steps needed to complete a transformation job. The figure below shows an example job plan created by the agent to outline to the user how it is planning to complete the transformation job.

Figure. Example of ATX Job Plan Created by A Transformation Agent

To keep the customers informed with the job progress, the job plan is constantly being updated by the agent to reflect which steps are complete, which steps require human attention (also known as HITL tasks) and which steps are yet to complete. 

### How is a job plan typically created?

A job plan is created by the agent performing the transformation job via invoking ATX Job API (see section 8.2 ATX Agentic API Specification for details).

Agent may invoke ATX Job API with the following forms,

A direct API invocation

Via ATX AgenticMCP server

## ATX Agent FAQs

This section covers commonly asked questions about ATX agents, more details about using ATX Base Agent package to develop ATX agents can be found in 10.1.

### What is the minimum requirement for an agent to be an ATX agent?

An ATX agent is an agent that is cable of communicating with agents/customers via ATX API and can perform transformation domain specific tasks.

This requires the agent runtime having:

A HTTP server support /invocations and /ping API endpoints;

The agent can get input job Id through environment variable or /invocations, get the job details, generate a plan, execute the plan and finish the job.

### Do I have to use ATX provided base agent to build my agent?

No. 

ATX base agent provides a good starting point to build your domain agent. However, it is not necessary to use it. You can always build everything from scratch when you agent container follows the minimum agent requirement.

### May I use langgraph to build my agent instead of strands agent?

Yes.

You can either use langgraph or strands agent to build your domain agent.

### How the orchestrator agent select subagents?

When you create the orchestrator agent, you can specify which subagents can be used optionally. Or this process can be totally dynamically decided by orchestrator agent in the runtime, based on the subagents in the agent registry.

### How does AgentCore integration work with ATX?

AgentCore provides a serverless runtime for ATX agents using JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol. 

Key aspects:

Single Endpoint: All ATX operations go through /invocations

Session Isolation: Each job runs in isolated microVMs

Automatic Context: ATX context is extracted from any request type

Protocol Compatibility: Supports both ATX operations and A2A messaging

Managed Infrastructure: No need to manage servers or scaling

### What’s the difference between BaseAgent AgentRuntimeServer and the traditional CLI approach?

AgentRuntimeServer: Designed for AgentCore, uses JSON-RPC, single endpoint

Traditional CLI: Multiple REST endpoints, designed for MDE/ECS deployment

Base Agent Package: Supports both approaches through different entry points

Both use the same BaseOrchestrator and agent factory pattern, so you can switch between deployment models with minimal code changes.

## HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) Task FAQs

### What are HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) Tasks?

HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) enables transformation agents to request human expertise at critical points during transformation processes. Tasks that appear in the Job Plan are marked as requiring human input. When agents need human input, they choose to pause execution and present relevant context to human operators, including files, configurations, and decision points. Human operators review the information, make necessary decisions or modifications, and approve continuation. This approach ensures complex transformations maintain accuracy while leveraging both AI agent efficiency and human judgment where expertise is most valuable.

### HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) blocking vs non-blocking

An agent produces a blocking HITL mean it will halt until human completes the task, while a non-blocking HITL task allows agents to continue transformation processes. Currently, we only support blocking HITL tasks for external agents.

### Standard vs critical HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) task

HITL tasks are classified as standard or critical. Standard HITL tasks can be approved and submitted by contributors, approvers, or administrators. Critical HITL tasks require approver or administrator roles for submission and are used for cases like code merges into main branches or production deployments.

### What are the available HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) UI for Agent?

# Troubleshooting

## Troubleshoot Local Testing - SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED Error with Boto3

### Symptom

When attempting to connect to an AWS endpoint using Boto3, you encounter an SSL error similar to the following:

botocore.exceptions.SSLError: SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED... unable to get local issuer certificate

This typically occurs when executing a command like 

boto3.client(…)

### Root Cause

This issue most commonly arises in corporate environments that employ an SSL-intercepting proxy or firewall. The standard Boto3 certificate validation is affected in the following way:

Proxy Interference: The corporate network appliance (proxy) intercepts and inspects all encrypted (HTTPS) traffic.

Certificate Substitution: The proxy terminates the SSL connection and then re-establishes a new one to your machine. It uses a substitute certificate signed by an internal Corporate Certificate Authority (CA), not a publicly trusted one.

Validation Failure: The Botocore library (used by Boto3) validates the certificate against its own built-in bundle of trusted CAs (botocore/cacert.pem). Since this bundle does not contain your corporate CA's root certificate, it cannot establish a valid chain of trust, resulting in the CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED error.

Certificate Chain Details

When the SSL handshake fails, the proxy presents its certificate, which is signed by your corporate CA. For example, a successful connection would look for a chain like this:

Target (Service): iad.gamma.agenticapi.elastic-gumby.ai.aws.dev

Intermediate CA: Amazon RSA 2048 M03

Root CA: A trusted public root (contained in the Botocore bundle)

In a proxy environment, the handshake might present a different chain, which Botocore cannot validate:

Proxy Target: A substitute certificate (signed by your Corporate CA)

Proxy Intermediate CA: Your Corporate CA

Proxy Root CA: Your Corporate Root CA

### Solution 1: Use a Combined CA Bundle

The recommended solution is to create a custom CA bundle that includes both the standard Botocore certificates and your corporate CA certificate. You then instruct Boto3 to use this combined bundle by setting the AWS_CA_BUNDLE environment variable.

Obtain your Corporate CA Certificate: Request the certificate file (e.g., corporate-ca.pem) from your IT support team.

Find the Botocore bundle: Locate the cacert.pem file within your virtual environment.

BOTOCORE_BUNDLE=$(python3 -c "import botocore, os; print(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(botocore.__file__), 'cacert.pem'))")

echo $BOTOCORE_BUNDLE

Create a combined bundle: Concatenate the two certificate files into a new, single file.

cat /path/to/corporate-ca.pem "$BOTOCORE_BUNDLE" > /path/to/my-combined-ca-bundle.pem

Set the environment variable: Set the AWS_CA_BUNDLE environment variable to the path of your new combined bundle.

export AWS_CA_BUNDLE=/path/to/my-combined-ca-bundle.pem

Verify: Run your Boto3 application. 

### Solution 2: Use proxy_ca_bundle in Config

This method involves passing the path to the custom CA bundle directly in the Boto3 client's configuration. It is more granular than the environment variable method, as it only affects clients explicitly configured this way.

Obtain your Corporate CA Certificate: Request the certificate file (e.g., corporate-ca.pem) from your IT support team.

Combine the bundles: Follow steps 2 and 3 from Solution 1 to create a combined certificate bundle.

For local testing or in a controlled development environment, you can instruct Boto3 to skip SSL certificate validation entirely by setting verify=False when creating the client. 

Update verify option in dependencies/ElasticGumbyPlatformPartnerBaseAgent/src/agent_builder_sdk/agentic_framework/client_factory.py to use corporate proxy

Re-install ATX dependencies via pip3 install -r requirements.txt with modified code

Security Warning: Disabling SSL verification is not recommended for production environments as it exposes your application to security risks, including man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Troubleshooting AgentCore Testing – 422 Unprocessable Entity Error

A 422 Unprocessable Entity error in AgentCore testing indicates that the server has validated the request's format but found semantic errors in the payload, preventing it from being processed. While a missing input field is a common cause, other validation issues can also trigger this error.

This troubleshooting guide provides steps to diagnose and resolve different causes of a 422 error.

### Symptom

The 422 Unprocessable Entity is usually triggered and can be seen from an invocation of an AgentCore runtime instance, for example,

aws bedrock-agentcore invoke-agent-runtime \

--agent-runtime-arn "arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-west-2:<account_id>:runtime/hosted_agent_vhusc-wjnEz2AJN3" \

--content-type "application/json" \

--accept "application/json" \

--payload $BASE64_MSG \

--region us-west-2 \

response.json

An error occurred (RuntimeClientError) when calling the InvokeAgentRuntime operation: Received error (422) from runtime. Please check your CloudWatch logs for more information.

### Step 1: Examine the AgentCore logs in CloudWatch

The most detailed information about the validation failure will be in your agent's logs, published to Amazon CloudWatch. Search for the specific invocation that failed.

Run a query in CloudWatch Logs Insights to filter for the error message. 

fields @timestamp, @message, @logStream, @log 

| filter @message like /422/ 
| filter @message like /Unprocessable/
| sort @timestamp desc 
| limit 10000

### Step 2: Validate general payload structure 

Confirm that your request payload matches the expected JSON structure for the AgentCore runtime. 

Missing or incorrect fields: The AgentCore runtime has specific requirements for the payload, including mandatory fields. 

Malformed JSON: Even if your test sends JSON, a syntax error (e.g., a misplaced comma or bracket) could cause the agent to fail during deserialization. Use a JSON linter to check for errors.

Missing or incorrect Content-Type header: The server must be told that you are sending a JSON payload. Always include the Content-Type: application/json header in your request.

### Step 3: Validate ATX specific payload structure

Agents built on AgentCore for ATX, is invoked by ATX service with certain specific structure, for example, ATX invokes AgentCore agent following JSONRPC schema with different payload structure of different ATX operations, make sure when your testing your AgentCore runtime, with the exact same payload structure required by ATX in Testing AgentCore Runtime with Additional Operations.

## Troubleshooting “Either endpoint_url or both stage and region must be provided” in Bedrock AgentCore

The error message, "Either endpoint_url or both stage and region must be provided," indicates that the Bedrock AgentCore runtime is missing crucial configuration details. Specifically, it has not received the required environment variables to determine the correct API endpoint for your agent. This often occurs when the agent's deployment process fails to pass the necessary STAGE and REGION environment variables.

### Solution: Update the runtime environment variables

To fix this issue, you need to manually update the environment variables for your agent's runtime in the AWS console.

Navigate to the Bedrock AgentCore console. Log in to the AWS Management Console and find the Bedrock AgentCore service.

Locate your agent's runtime. In the Bedrock AgentCore dashboard, find and select the specific agent that is throwing the error.

Update the hosting configuration. Within your agent's details page, you should find an "Update hosting" option. Click this button to modify the runtime settings.

Access advanced configurations. A pop-up or new page will appear for configuring the agent's hosting. Look for an "Advanced configurations" section to manage environment variables.

Add the STAGE environment variable.

Click on "Environment variables."

Add a new key-value pair.

For the Key, enter STAGE.

For the Value, enter the name of your deployment stage (e.g., Gamma).

## Base Agent Code Walkthrough

ATX Base Agent code package is a foundational agent package for partners to easily extend and build their agents, built on Amazon's Strands framework with capabilities for production deployment.

### What This Package Provides

This is your starting point for building agents that integrate with the ATX Platform. Instead of building from scratch, you extend the AsyncBaseOrchestrator class and customize it for your specific use case.

### Core Architecture

AsyncBaseOrchestrator and AsyncBaseSubagent: Extensible agent class built on Strands SDK

Production Runtime: AgentRuntimeServer for containerized deployment (legacy FastAPI server also available)

Development Tools: Console mode with tracing for local testing and debugging. See DEVELOPMENT.md

Platform Integration: Provided ATX platform connectivity and lifecycle management

Checkpointing Functionality: Background agent memory/conversation persistence with configurable triggers for recovery and continuity

### Understanding Agents and Entry Points

#### What is an Agent?

An agent is the core logic that processes requests and makes decisions. All agents implement the BaseAgent or AsyncBaseAgent protocol, which defines a standardized interface (process_message or process_message_async) that enables any agent implementing this protocol to be pluggable into our AgentRuntimeServer infrastructure and other components.

This package provides two BaseAgent implementations:

BaseOrchestrator: Manages complex workflows and coordinates multiple tasks

BaseSubagent: Handles specific, focused tasks within a workflow

Each also has an equivalent AsyncBaseAgent implementation: AsyncBaseOrchestrator and AsyncBaseSubagent. You probably want to use these async versions, especially if used with AgentRuntimeServer. The synchronous implementations call the asynchronous functions under the hood. Each call to invoke the agent creates a new asyncio event loop in a separate thread taken from a thread pool. This is inefficient, particularly when your application already has a running asyncio event loop (which is the case when using AgentRuntimeServer).

#### What is an Entry Point?

An entry point is the executable that starts your agent as a service (the entry command running in the container). This package provides following reference implementations:

simple_cli_agent_core.py - (NEW) Simplified AgentRuntimeServer:

Simplified interface: Combines both into a single unified server

Agent factory pattern: Pluggable agent

Compatible protocols: Supports both Bedrock AgentCore and ATX agentic compute endpoints

_simple_stateless_cli_agent_core.py - (NEW) StatelessAgentRuntimeServer:

Stateless server: Uses StatelessAgentRuntimeServer for subagent deployments

No storage dependency: Simplified runtime without persistent state

Concurrent processing: Handles multiple requests simultaneously

Agent factory pattern: Pluggable agent

Compatible protocols: Supports both Bedrock AgentCore and ATX agentic compute endpoints

cli.py - For orchestrator agents:

FastAPI server: HTTP endpoints for receiving requests

Queue service: Processes requests sequentially to maintain state

Single-threaded: Prevents requests from stepping on each other

subagent_cli.py - For subagents:

Subagent server: Lightweight server for subagent requests

Stateless: Can handle concurrent requests without queue

Simpler: No queue service needed for specialized tasks

See Runtime Architecture for how these components work together.

### Runtime Architecture

This section gives you an overview the runtime architecture of your agent as a Docker container.

#### Orchestrator Runtime Architecture

When running in production (container mode), your orchestrator agent operates as a service with the flow of

HTTP Request → FastAPI server receives A2A messages or platform notifications

Queue Enqueue → Requests are prioritized and queued for processing

Sequential Processing → Queue service processes one request at a time

Agent Execution → Your orchestrator handles the request using Strands framework

Checkpoint Trigger → After successful processing, checkpoint callback increments conversation turns or time-based triggers

Background Checkpointing → Background task periodically saves agent state to ATX platform

Response → Results are returned via HTTP response or stored for async retrieval

### Building Orchestrator Agents

To proceed with building Orchestrator Agents, you’re expected to complete 3.2	Setting Up Your Development Environment, with the following available:

AWS Credentials: Bedrock access for model inference, 

MCP Binary: 

Agentic Model:

aws configure add-model --service-model file://$(pwd)/elasticgumbyagentic-2018-05-10.normal.json --service-name elasticgumbyagenticservice

Python version: Configure your version set with recommended Python 3.11. Python 3.10 still works but is not officially supported.

#### Create Your Orchestrator Class

# In your agent package (e.g., MyCustomAgent)

from agent_builder_sdk.orchestrator_strands.base_orchestrator import AsyncBaseOrchestrator

class MyCustomOrchestrator(AsyncBaseOrchestrator):

    """Your custom orchestrator implementation."""

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):

        super().__init__(

            system_prompt="You are a specialized orchestrator for...",

            **kwargs

        )

        # Add your custom tools, hooks, conversation implementation

See Strands Documentation for more details about hooks, etc.

#### Create Custom Tools (Optional)

Define your domain-specific tools using Strands decorators:

# custom_tools.py

from strands.tools import tool


@tool

def my_custom_tool(param: str) -> str:

    """Your custom tool description."""

    return f"Processed: {param}"

@tool

def another_tool(value: int) -> bool:

    """Another example tool."""

    return value > 0

See Strands Tools Documentation for more details.

#### Create Your Entry Point - AgentCore (Recommended for AgentCore)

For a simpler approach, use the new AgentRuntimeServer with a custom agent factory. This server is compatible with both Bedrock AgentCore runtime protocols and ATX agentic compute endpoints. See simple_cli_agent_core.py for a complete example:

Implementation:

# my_agent_cli.py

from agent_builder_sdk.server.agent_runtime_server import AgentRuntimeServer

from agent_builder_sdk.agent_factory import create_default_orchestrator

def main():

    # Create custom agent factory. Use create_default_orchestrator for our default OR create a new factory method for MyCustomOrchestrator

    def agent_factory(mcp_client, storage_dir):

        return create_default_orchestrator(

            mcp_client=mcp_client,

            storage_dir=storage_dir,

            system_prompt="Your custom system prompt here"

        )

    # Start server with your factory

    server = AgentRuntimeServer(

        agent_factory=agent_factory,

        host="0.0.0.0",

        port=8080,

        binary_location="./eg_agentic_mcp_server",

        storage_dir="/tmp/my_agent",

        checkpoint_strategy="conversation", #optional field, enable the checkpoint

        checkpoint_interval=10, #optional field, enable the checkpoint

    )

    server.start()

if __name__ == "__main__":

    main()

Supported JSON-RPC Methods: The server automatically handles these AgentCore operations:

#### Create Your Entry Point – Old CLI Approach

The easiest way is to copy the existing cli.py and replace the agent with yours:

# my_orchestrator_cli.py

# Copy from cli.py and modify the create_orchestrator function:

from my_custom_agent.custom_tools.sub_agent_tool import (my_custom_tool, another_tool)

def create_orchestrator(args, mcp_client: Optional[MCPClient]) -> MyCustomOrchestrator:

    """Override to return your custom orchestrator."""

    # Configure memory components (optional, custom component provided by ATX)

    # - FileSystemRepository: File-based memory storage

    memory_storage_path = os.path.join(args.storage_dir, "memories")

    repository = FileSystemRepository(storage_path=memory_storage_path)

    # - EpisodicMemory: Episodic memory (events, decisions) management

    episodic_memory = EpisodicMemory(repository=repository)

    # - MemoryManager: Memory coordination

    memory_manager = MemoryManager(memories=[episodic_memory])

    # - Custom memory tool provided by ATX

    memory_tool = MemoryTool(memory_manager)

    # Configure conversation management (optional, custom component provided by ATX)

    # - FileMultiSourceConversationRepository: Multi-source conversation storage

    conversation_repository = FileMultiSourceConversationRepository(storage_dir=args.storage_dir)

    # Configure hooks (optional, custom component provided by ATX)

    # - ConversationHookProvider: Before/after conversation events

    # - MemoryHookProvider: Before/after memory operations

    hooks = [

        ConversationHookProvider(repository=conversation_repository),

        MemoryHookProvider(memory_manager=memory_manager),

    ]

    # Create your custom orchestrator with available options:

    orchestrator = MyCustomOrchestrator(

        system_prompt="Your custom system prompt...",

        hooks=hooks,  # Custom lifecycle hooks

        model_id=args.model_id,  # Bedrock model selection

        # guardrail_id=args.guardrail_id,     # Bedrock guardrails ID (optional, requires CDK set up)

        mcp_clients=[mcp_client],  # ATX agentic MCP added by default, add you custom MCP clients

        region_name=args.region,  # AWS region

        custom_tools=[memory_tool.memory, my_custom_tool, another_tool],  # Pass any of your custom tools 

    )

    return orchestrator

# Keep all other methods from cli.py as-is

#### Local Testing

Set up environment variables according to Configuration and add eg_agentic_mcp_server to –binaryLocation.

The --localTesting mode allows you to directly talk to the agent and get responses. Without --localTesting, you will be starting the local server, so you can follow the below API Reference below to test endpoints with curl.

# Build your package

bb release

# Console mode: Talk directly to the agent and get responses

python src/my_custom_agent/my_orchestrator_cli.py \

 --localTesting \

 --workingDir . \

 --storage-dir . \

 --binaryLocation ./eg_agentic_mcp_server

# Server mode: Start local server and queue service to test API endpoints with curl in another terminal

python src/my_custom_agent/my_orchestrator_cli.py \

  --workingDir . \

  --storage-dir . \

  --binaryLocation ./eg_agentic_mcp_server \

  --queueStoragePath .

### Building Subagents

#### Create Your Subagent Class

# In your agent package (e.g., MyCustomSubagent)

from agent_builder_sdk.base_subagent.base_subagent import AsyncBaseSubagent

class MyCustomSubagent(AsyncBaseSubagent):

    """Your custom subagent implementation."""

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):

        super().__init__(

            system_prompt="You are a specialized subagent for...",

            **kwargs

        )

        # Add your custom tools and specialized logic

#### Create Custom Tools (Optional)

Define your domain-specific tools using Strands decorators:

# custom_subagent_tools.py

from strands.tools import tool

@tool

def specialized_processing_tool(data: str) -> str:

    """Process data for specific subagent task."""

    return f"Processed: {data}"

@tool

def validation_tool(input_value: str) -> bool:

    """Validate input for subagent processing."""

    return len(input_value) > 0

See Strands Tools Documentation for more details.

#### Create Your Entry Point

The StatelessAgentRuntimeServer is well-suited for subagents as it handles requests without persistent state. However, you can use either server type with any agent type based on your requirements. This example shows the stateless approach for subagents. See _simple_stateless_cli_agent_core.py for a complete example:

Note: You can also use AgentRuntimeServer for subagents if you need persistent state or queue-based processing. Both server types work with any agent type.

# my_subagent_cli.py

from agent_builder_sdk.server.stateless_agent_runtime_server import StatelessAgentRuntimeServer

from agent_builder_sdk.agent_factory import create_default_subagent

def main():

    # Create custom agent factory. Use create_default_subagent for our default OR create a new factory method for MyCustomSubagent

    def agent_factory(mcp_client):

        return create_default_subagent(

            mcp_client=mcp_client,

            system_prompt="Your custom subagent system prompt here"

        )

    # Start stateless server with your factory

    server = StatelessAgentRuntimeServer(

        agent_factory=agent_factory,

        host="0.0.0.0",

        port=8080,

        binary_location="./eg_agentic_mcp_server"

    )

    server.start()

if __name__ == "__main__":

    main()

#### Local Testing

Set up environment variables according to Configuration and add eg_agentic_mcp_server to --binaryLocation. Start the localk server and follow the API Reference below to test endpoints with curl.

# Start local stateless server to test API endpoints with curl in another terminal

python src/my_custom_subagent/my_subagent_cli.py \

  --binaryLocation ./eg_agentic_mcp_server

### API Reference

#### HTTP Endpoints

These endpoints correspond to Bedrock AgentCore runtime endpoints and A2A protocol specifications:

#### Notifications Handler (/invocations)

The package includes a provided ATX system notification handler in notification_handler.py that helps handle notifications received from the ATX platform.

The notification handler is used by default with the built-in FastAPI implementation for processing /invocations endpoint requests.

#### Checkpointing Functionality

The package includes built-in checkpointing functionality designed for stateful agents that maintain conversation history, memory, and request queue state. This feature is integrated directly into AgentRuntimeServer (not StatelessAgentRuntimeServer) and provides two checkpoint strategies: time-based and conversation-based triggers. Checkpointing enables automatic failover and state restoration, ensuring your stateful agent can recover from failures and continue conversations seamlessly without losing context or progress.

##### When to Use Each Strategy

Conversation-based checkpointing is ideal for:

Interactive agents with user conversations

Agents where each conversation turn represents meaningful progress

Recommended for most orchestrator agents

Time-based checkpointing is ideal for:

Long-running background processes

Batch processing or automated workflows

When you need predictable checkpoint intervals regardless of activity

##### Components

CheckpointService: Manages checkpoint lifecycle and integrates with AgentRuntimeServer

CheckpointRepository: Handles checkpoint data storage and retrieval

CheckpointManager: Manages checkpoint business logic and workflow coordination

CheckpointTriggers: Configurable triggers for when to create checkpoints

##### Usage

Enable checkpointing when creating your AgentRuntimeServer:

# Time-based checkpointing (every 30 minutes)

server = AgentRuntimeServer(

        agent_factory=my_factory,

        host="0.0.0.0",

        port=8080,

        binary_location="./eg_agentic_mcp_server",

        storage_dir="/tmp/my_agent",

        checkpoint_strategy="time",

        checkpoint_interval=30

)

# Conversation-based checkpointing (every 5 conversation turns)

server = AgentRuntimeServer(

        agent_factory=my_factory,

        host="0.0.0.0",

        port=8080,

        binary_location="./eg_agentic_mcp_server",

        storage_dir="/tmp/my_agent",

        checkpoint_strategy="conversation",

        checkpoint_interval=5

)

# Restoration-only mode (restores existing checkpoints but creates no new ones)

# Checkpointing is disabled

server = AgentRuntimeServer(

        agent_factory=my_factory,

        host="0.0.0.0",

        port=8080,

        binary_location="./eg_agentic_mcp_server",

        storage_dir="/tmp/my_agent"

)

### Configuration

#### Required Environment Variables

# ATX Platform Integration. Pass in real ones if you want to test calling Agentic APIs

export WORKSPACE_ID=your-workspace-id              # ATX workspace identifier

export JOB_ID=your-job-id                          # Current job identifier  

export AGENT_INSTANCE_ID=your-agent-instance-id    # Agent instance identifier

export AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN=<<MY_SECRET_TOKEN>>     # Auth token

# ATX API Endpoint (e.g. ATX Gamma)

export QT_AGENTIC_API_ENDPOINT=https://iad.gamma.agenticapi.elastic-gumby.ai.aws.dev

# AWS Configuration  

export AWS_REGION=us-west-2                        # AWS region for Bedrock

#### Optional Environment Variables

# Optional Bedrock configs

export BEDROCK_GUARDRAIL_ID=27brr38ufca0           # Bedrock guardrail ID

export BEDROCK_GUARDRAIL_VERSION=1                 # Guardrail version

#### Bedrock Guardrails

Bedrock guardrails provide content filtering and safety controls for your agent interactions. When configured, guardrails help ensure responses meet your organization's content policies.

Setup: Guardrails must be created via CDK deployment - see AWS CDK Bedrock Guardrail documentation

Configuration: Set BEDROCK_GUARDRAIL_ID and BEDROCK_GUARDRAIL_VERSION environment variables

Optional: Guardrails are optional - agents will work without them but won't have content filtering

#### Available Tools & Integrations

Your agent automatically has access to ATX platform tools via MCP integration: ElasticGumbyAgenticMCP
